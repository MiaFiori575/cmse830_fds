This file contains the near infrared spectral data collected from deionized water, blackwater, and treated blackwater. In addition, physiochemical parameters like turbidity (NTU), percent total solids (TS) and
percent total suspended solids.
A correlation between spectral signature, turbidity and other physiochemical parameters will be attempted. If a correlation exists, this will be submitted as a new way to quantify TS and TSS in the field so as to
avoid the 24-hour processing time for TS and TSS results from samples
